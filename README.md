Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?\
The client "The Gaming Room" were wanting a web-based game to be created that could host multiple different platforms to reach a larger audience. They wished for an app that could host unique instances of the game, teams and players, whereas no more than one of each of these could exist at a time. The software they wanted was simply a game called "draw it or lose it" which would produce images during a game round, each over a period of 30 seconds where teams would have to take turns guessing the image being shown before the timer runs out.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?\
I feel I did my best, for this documentation at least, when doing the evaluations of server side, client side, and development tools for each platform. I had to do a good deal of research for each platform, as I am not very familiar with others outside of windows. I managed to pull together a good collection of information for each platform and I felt proud of my accomplishment.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?\
I did not really find the design document to be of too much help overall when developing the code, however the UML diagram was probably the single most useful thing in the entire document, it truly outlines the required components and gives me a strong sense of what is expected or needed.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?\
I felt the executive summary was the weakest part of this document, and discussing design constraints feels vague and could use some improvement. The only way to improve this is to have a stronger understanding of how everything works, when I wrote it I only had a surface deep understanding. I would probably go back now and try to add more depth to my explanation and understanding of each aspect.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?\
The user's needs are essentially everything when it comes to designing the software. As they are the ones who are "using" it, their needs come first and should be the forefront of development. I interpreted the users needs as needing the ability to create unique team names, for example, and so that only one of these could exist. It may not seem like much but it is important enough to ensure other teams do not get overwritten by someone else.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?\
The use of design templates or other such archetypes were the backbone of the software development for me. Once I created the basic outline or framework of a specific template, I could apply it to every aspect of the application that needed it. Especially in regards to the creation of unique team name, player names, and so on. All I had to do was rearrange the variable names used for each template after a quick copy paste, and it all ran smoothly. It took no time at all in fact and I was surprised how useful templates could be.
